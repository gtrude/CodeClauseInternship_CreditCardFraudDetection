# CodeClauseInternship_CreditCardFraudDetection

This project employs machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to detect instances of credit card fraud. The Logistic Regression model provides interpretability, while the KNN algorithm 
captures complex patterns in the data. 
The initial dataset exhibited an imbalance, prompting the implementation of preprocessing techniques to address this issue. 
Additionally, feature scaling was applied as part of the comprehensive preprocessing strategy employed to enhance the overall data quality and ensure a more robust analytical foundation.
The project aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. 
The repository contains code, dataset, and documentation.
